Dev-only floating inspector for **Next.js + React 18/19**. Hover or click any
DOM element to see **which source file (with line number) rendered it**, open
it straight in your editor, view live props and store state, reverse-lookup
i18n keys from rendered text, flash component re-renders, and copy the whole
context for your AI assistant.

Zero runtime dependencies. Never ships to production when gated correctly
(see [Production safety](#production-safety-dead-code-elimination)).

## Features

**Find the source**

- Hover highlight with a `<Component> · file.tsx:42` chip and element dimensions
- Click to lock the full component chain up to the app root, each entry with `file:line`
- Click any entry to open that file in your editor at the exact line
- Box-model overlay (margin/padding bands) like browser devtools

**Understand the state**

- **Props** tab — live props of any component in the chain (compact JSON tree)
- **Props change tracking** — before/after previews for the latest observed
  changes, including added/removed props and changed object/function references;
  pause/resume sampling or reset the comparison baseline
- **State** tab — snapshot of your store; Redux, Zustand, Jotai, anything —
  you supply the getter
- **i18n reverse lookup** — which translation key produced this rendered text
  (i18next-shaped resources)
- **History** tab — revisit the last 8 inspected elements

**See it move**

- **Re-render flasher** — with the optional [early hook](#true-re-render-flashes-optional-hook),
  outlines components as they re-render, labeled `Clock ×3`; without it, falls
  back to flashing raw DOM mutations

**Work fast**

- **Component browser** — search component names, step through matching
  instances, and navigate a collapsible component tree to select source and props
- **Dockable, resizable panel** — float beside the launcher or dock left/right;
  drag the panel edge to resize, with position and width saved locally

- **Copy for AI** — one click copies chain + paths + props + i18n keys, ready
  to paste into Claude Code, Cursor, or any coding assistant
- Alt+hover quick inspect, arrow-key DOM walking, configurable hotkeys
- Single draggable launcher button that expands into the action menu, position persisted to `localStorage`

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| React / ReactDOM | >= 18 (peer deps); best on 19 |
| Next.js | `next dev` — Turbopack and webpack (`--webpack`) both verified |
| Environment | Development builds only — relies on React's dev-only fiber internals |
| Runtime deps | None |

## Quick start

```sh
npm i -D next-dev-inspector
```

Mount it anywhere in your client tree:

```tsx
import DevInspector from "next-dev-inspector";

<DevInspector />
```

Then hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> and hover anything — or press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> and click. For real projects,
use the env-gated mount below so the package never reaches production bundles.

## Production safety (dead-code elimination)

The inspector reads React's dev-only fiber internals (`_debugStack`,
`_debugOwner`), so it only works in development — and it should be *compiled
out* of production bundles. Gate it on constants your bundler can statically
evaluate:

### App Router

```tsx
// app/dev-inspector.tsx
"use client";
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const Inspector = dynamic(() => import("next-dev-inspector"), { ssr: false });

export function DevInspectorMount() {
  if (
    process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development" ||
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_INSPECTOR !== "true"
  ) {
    return null;
  }
  return <Inspector />;
}
```

Render `<DevInspectorMount />` at the end of your root layout's `<body>`.

### Pages Router

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const DevInspector =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" &&
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_INSPECTOR === "true"
    ? dynamic(() => import("next-dev-inspector"), { ssr: false })
    : null;

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
      {DevInspector && <DevInspector />}
    </>
  );
}
```

Run with the flag:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_INSPECTOR=true next dev
```

Because both conditions are build-time constants, the `import()` — and the
whole package — is eliminated from production output.

## Controls

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> | Arm / disarm the inspector (configurable via `hotkey`) |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + hover | Quick inspect without arming (configurable via `hoverModifier`) |
| Click (while inspecting) | Lock the details panel on that element |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>↓</kbd> <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> | Walk the DOM (parent / first child / siblings) while locked |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Close panel, disarm |
| Wrench button | Open / close the action menu — also the drag handle |
| Crosshair button (in menu) | Arm / disarm the inspector |
| Zap button (in menu) | Toggle the re-render / DOM-update flasher |
| Source row click | Open that file in your editor |
| `{ }` icon on a row | Jump to that entry's Props tab |

## Component browser and panel layout

Open the wrench menu and choose **Browse components**, or use the **Tree** tab
after inspecting an element. Search is case-insensitive; **Previous** and
**Next** (or Enter / Shift+Enter in the search field) step through instances.
Hover a row to highlight its rendered element. Select a row to scroll to it,
then open **Source** or **Props** to inspect that component.

Expand/collapse rows to explore each component's real children. Focus a tree
row and use Up/Down to navigate, Left/Right to collapse/expand, or Enter to
select. Use **Refresh** after navigation, conditional rendering, or code edits.

The tree represents the actual render nesting of components with DOM elements
in the current document (not JSX ownership — a component that only renders
`{props.children}`, like a layout or provider wrapper, still shows up as a
real ancestor of what it wraps), including available Server Component debug
metadata. It omits components with no rendered element, iframe contents,
shadow-root contents, and the inspector's own UI. Large pages are capped at
5,000 DOM elements and 1,000 component instances, with a visible truncation
notice. Check **Only app components** to hide components whose source resolves
to nothing app-owned (library/generated code), reattaching their children to
the nearest surviving ancestor.

Use the **Panel** selector to float or dock left/right. Drag the outside edge
(the left edge when docked right) to resize, or focus that edge and use
Left/Right. Width stays within the viewport. Layout is stored under
`<storageKey>:panel`; docking overlays the page without changing its layout.

## Props change tracking

The Props tab samples the selected component every 250 ms while open, without
requiring the early hook. It compares up to 200 own enumerable string-keyed
props using `Object.is` and retains the latest change until another change or
reset. Switching components or closing the tab starts a fresh comparison.
Nested mutations of the same object and changes between samples may be missed.
Before/after previews are truncated; identical previews can still represent
different object or function references. These are observed prop changes,
not proof of what caused a render.

## True re-render flashes (optional hook)

By default the Zap button flashes *DOM mutations* — a memoized re-render that
changes no DOM stays invisible. For true re-render tracking, React must see a
DevTools hook **before it loads**, which a widget rendered by React cannot
provide. So the package ships one as an inline script you mount yourself:

```tsx
// App Router — top of app/layout.tsx's <body> (it's a server-safe component)
import { DevInspectorHook } from "next-dev-inspector/hook";

<body>
  <DevInspectorHook />   {/* renders nothing in production */}
  {children}
</body>
```

```tsx
// Pages Router — pages/_document.tsx, inside <Head>
import { devInspectorHookScript } from "next-dev-inspector/hook";

{process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && (
  <script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: devInspectorHookScript }} />
)}
```

With the hook installed, flashes carry component names (`Clock ×3`) and fire
per re-render — the widget detects it automatically. If the real React
DevTools extension is present, the script piggybacks on its hook instead of
replacing it.

![Re-render flash with component name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infinitietechnologies/dev-inspector/master/docs/screenshot-flash.png)

## Copy for AI

The locked panel's footer has a **Copy for AI** button that puts a compact,
paste-ready context block on the clipboard:

```
Inspected element (via next-dev-inspector):

Component chain (innermost first):
1. button — components/ProductCard.tsx:20
2. <ProductCard> — app/page.tsx:26
3. <Page> — (library / generated)

Props of <ProductCard>:
{ name: "Espresso", price: 2.5 }

i18n matches:
- product.add_to_cart (en) = "Add to cart"
```

Paste it into your AI assistant and it knows exactly which file and component
you're talking about. (`buildAiContext` / `serializeValue` are also exported
if you want the same block programmatically.)

## Configuration

All props are optional:

```tsx
<DevInspector
  enabled={true}
  hotkey="ctrl+shift+x"
  hoverModifier="alt"
  storageKey="dev-inspector-pos"
  zIndex={2147483000}
  colors={{ accent: "#7c3aed", accentLight: "#a78bfa", flash: "#f97316" }}
  editorEndpoint="/__nextjs_launch-editor"
  stackFramesEndpoint="/__nextjs_original-stack-frames"
  getI18nData={() => ({ data: i18n.store.data, language: i18n.language })}
  getStateSnapshot={() => store.getState()}
  stateLabel="Redux store"
/>
```

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Render nothing when `false` (combine with env gating for DCE) |
| `hotkey` | `string` | `"ctrl+shift+x"` | Arm/disarm combo — modifiers + key joined with `+` |
| `hoverModifier` | `"alt" \| "ctrl" \| "meta" \| "shift" \| "none"` | `"alt"` | Held key that enables hover-inspect without arming; `"none"` disables |
| `storageKey` | `string` | `"dev-inspector-pos"` | `localStorage` key for the launcher-button position |
| `zIndex` | `number` | `2147483000` | Base z-index for all overlay layers |
| `colors` | `{ accent?, accentLight?, flash? }` | violet / orange | Palette overrides, hex `#rrggbb` |
| `editorEndpoint` | `string` | `"/__nextjs_launch-editor"` | GET endpoint that opens `file`/`line1`/`column1` in the editor |
| `editor` | `"vscode" \| "vscode-insiders" \| "cursor" \| "windsurf"` | — | Force an editor via its URL scheme instead of the dev server ([see below](#forcing-a-specific-editor)) |
| `projectRoot` | `string` | — | Absolute project root; needed by `editor` to absolutize relative source paths |
| `stackFramesEndpoint` | `string \| null` | `"/__nextjs_original-stack-frames"` | POST fallback resolver for webpack-dev frames; `null` disables |
| `getI18nData` | `() => { data, language? } \| null` | — | Enables i18n reverse lookup (see below) |
| `getStateSnapshot` | `() => unknown \| Promise<unknown>` | — | Enables the State tab (see below) |
| `stateLabel` | `string` | `"Store"` | Heading shown in the State tab |

### Store snapshots (`getStateSnapshot`)

The State tab appears only when you pass a getter. Any store works — sync or
async:

```tsx
// Redux (dynamic import keeps the store out of the widget's graph)
getStateSnapshot={async () => (await import("@/lib/redux/store")).store.getState()}

// Zustand
getStateSnapshot={() => useBoundStore.getState()}

// Jotai (with a store instance)
getStateSnapshot={() => Object.fromEntries(myAtoms.map(a => [a.debugLabel, store.get(a)]))}
```

### i18n reverse lookup (`getI18nData`)

Pass i18next-shaped resources (`{ [lng]: { [namespace]: nestedTree } }`) and
the current language:

```tsx
getI18nData={() => ({ data: i18n.store.data, language: i18n.language })}
```

When you lock an element, the Source tab lists translation keys whose value
matches its rendered text — exact matches first, then `{{interpolated}}`
values matched by static prefix.

### Forcing a specific editor

By default, clicking a source row asks the Next dev server to open the file,
and Next's `launch-editor` guesses the editor from running processes. Two ways
to pin it:

1. **Env var (no code)** — set `REACT_EDITOR` when starting the dev server;
   Next's launch-editor respects it:

   ```bash
   REACT_EDITOR=code next dev
   ```

2. **`editor` prop** — bypass the dev server entirely and open the editor's
   own URL scheme (`vscode://file/…:line:col`) from the browser. Relative
   source paths (Turbopack/webpack) need an absolute `projectRoot`, which you
   can inline at build time:

   ```js
   // next.config.mjs
   const nextConfig = {
     env: { NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ROOT: process.cwd() },
   };
   ```

   ```tsx
   <DevInspector
     editor="vscode" // or "vscode-insiders" | "cursor" | "windsurf"
     projectRoot={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ROOT}
   />
   ```

   If a path can't be made absolute, the click falls back to the dev-server
   endpoint, so this is safe to leave on.

### Other dev servers

`editorEndpoint` and `stackFramesEndpoint` exist so non-Next dev servers can
be targeted (e.g. Vite's `/__open-in-editor`, with
`stackFramesEndpoint={null}`) — but Vite serves different source-map URLs and
this is untested territory. The package is Next-first.

## API reference

### `next-dev-inspector`

| Export | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DevInspector` (also default) | component | The inspector widget |
| `buildAiContext(input)` | function | The "Copy for AI" text, programmatically |
| `serializeValue(value)` | function | The compact, cycle-safe value renderer it uses |
| `DevInspectorProps`, `DevInspectorColors`, `HoverModifier`, `AiContextInput`, `InspectedEntry`, `ResolvedLocation`, `ResolverOptions`, `RawStackFrame`, `I18nMatch`, `FlashEvent`, `BoxModel`, `BoxEdges`, `SourceMapPayload`, `OriginalPosition` | types | Public types |

### `next-dev-inspector/hook`

| Export | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DevInspectorHook` (also default) | component | Server-safe inline `<script>` mount; renders nothing outside development |
| `devInspectorHookScript` | string | The raw script, for `_document` or custom injection |

The main bundle is marked `"use client"`; the hook bundle is not, so it can
be imported from server components.

## How it works

- **React 18/19 source metadata:** React 18 locations come from `_debugSource`;
  React 19 client locations come from `_debugStack`. App Router Server
  Components are recovered from React 19's `_debugInfo` records and their
  server stack frames. These fields exist only in development React.
- **Turbopack (`next dev`):** the widget fetches the chunk's sibling
  `<chunk>.js.map` and decodes it client-side (index maps with `sections[]`,
  `file:///` sources). The dev server's `POST /__nextjs_original-stack-frames`
  resolver is *not* used for browser chunk frames — it hangs on `http://` file
  URLs and returns identity mappings.
- **webpack (`next dev`):** `webpack-internal:///` frames fall back to the
  server resolver endpoint.
- **SSR / React Server Components:** `about://React/Server/` frames are sent
  to the Next resolver with the server + App Router compilation flags.
- **Open in editor** uses `GET /__nextjs_launch-editor?file=&line1=&column1=`,
  which accepts `file://` URLs, absolute paths, and project-relative paths.
- **Re-render hook:** the inline script installs a minimal
  `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` before React loads and walks each commit
  as a diff against the alternate fiber tree, pruning subtrees whose child
  pointer is unchanged (the way React DevTools does) — `PerformedWork` flags
  alone are stale on fibers React reused without re-cloning.

## Limitations

- **Development only** — production React builds carry none of the fiber
  debug data this relies on. Gate the mount so bundlers strip it entirely.
- **Fiber internals are not public API.** They have been stable across React
  18/19 dev builds, but a future React release could move them.
- **Without the hook**, the flasher shows DOM mutations, not re-renders; a
  memoized re-render that changes no DOM won't flash.
- **Library components** resolve to the caller's JSX callsite (the first
  app-owned frame) — usually what you want anyway.
- **Editor opening** goes through the Next dev server; it opens whatever
  editor the server's launch-editor detection finds (VS Code, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Every entry says `library / generated` | Source maps unreachable — make sure you're on `next dev` (not a production build) and same-origin |
| Server Component rows have no file/line | Upgrade to a version with SSR/RSC `_debugInfo` support; production `next start` cannot expose dev-only locations |
| Rows never resolve on webpack dev | The fallback POSTs to `stackFramesEndpoint`; check it isn't disabled and the dev server is current |
| Clicking a row doesn't open the editor | The dev server's launch-editor couldn't find an editor — try opening a file from a Next error overlay to verify |
| Flashes have no component names | The early hook isn't installed — see [the hook section](#true-re-render-flashes-optional-hook); it must render before React loads |
| Hotkey does nothing | Another extension/app owns the combo — change the `hotkey` prop |
| Widget visible in production | Your gating isn't statically analyzable — both conditions must be literal `process.env` checks |

## Demo app

A runnable demo lives in [`demo/`](https://github.com/Infinitietechnologies/dev-inspector/tree/master/demo):

```sh
cd demo
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed URL and follow the "Things to try" list on the page: Alt+hover
anything, click to lock the source chain, open files in your editor, check the
i18n and State tabs, toggle the Zap button while the on-page clock ticks, and
try Copy for AI.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run test        # vitest — stack parsing, VLQ source maps, i18n lookup, hook script, AI context
npm run typecheck
npm run build       # tsup → dist/ (ESM + CJS + d.ts, two entries: index + hook)
```

CI runs all three on Node 20 and 22 for every push and PR. Releases are
tag-triggered: bump the version, update `CHANGELOG.md`, then
`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z` — the release workflow publishes
to npm with provenance via trusted publishing.

Layout: `src/` widget + pure modules · `tests/` vitest suites ·
`demo/` runnable Next 16 demo · `docs/` README screenshots.

## Project status

Pre-1.0. Verified against Next 16 + React 19, on both Turbopack and webpack
dev servers. Issue reports welcome.
